## Architecture

State lives in **one place** — `App.jsx`. The three panels are presentational: they receive data as props (solid lines) and send change requests up as callbacks (dashed lines).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph APP["App.jsx · Single Source of Truth"]
        direction TB
        S["State (useState)<br/>― recipes<br/>― selectedRecipeId<br/>― mealPlan<br/>― filters"]
        D["Derived each render<br/>― filteredRecipes<br/>― selectedRecipe<br/>― weeklyBudget<br/>― groceryList"]
        S --> D
    end

    B["Browser<br/>(left panel)<br/>reads + writes"]
    V["DetailView<br/>(center panel)<br/>read-only"]
    C["Controller<br/>(right panel)<br/>reads + writes"]

    APP ==>|"props ↓<br/>filteredRecipes,<br/>selectedRecipeId"| B
    APP ==>|"props ↓<br/>selectedRecipe"| V
    APP ==>|"props ↓<br/>filters, mealPlan,<br/>weeklyBudget,<br/>groceryList, …"| C

    B -.->|"onSelectRecipe(id)"| APP
    C -.->|"onFilterChange<br/>onAssignMeal<br/>onRemoveMeal<br/>onCookedIt"| APP
```

No child component holds its own copy of `selectedRecipeId`, `recipes`, `mealPlan`, or `filters`. Derived values are recomputed each render — never stored. See [src/App.jsx](src/App.jsx) for the four `useState` calls and the derivation logic.

## What triggers updates — the 4 state flows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor U as User
    participant B as Browser
    participant A as App.jsx (state)
    participant V as DetailView
    participant C as Controller

    rect rgb(255, 248, 240)
    Note over U,C: Flow 1 — Browser click → Detail updates
    U->>B: click recipe card
    B->>A: onSelectRecipe(id)
    A-->>V: re-render with new selectedRecipe
    end

    rect rgb(255, 243, 224)
    Note over U,C: Flow 2 — Filter change → Browser shrinks
    U->>C: change filter dropdown
    C->>A: onFilterChange(key, value)
    A-->>B: re-render with filteredRecipes (derived)
    end

    rect rgb(255, 248, 240)
    Note over U,C: Flow 3 — Assign meal → Budget + Grocery recalculate
    U->>C: click "+ Assign"
    C->>A: onAssignMeal(day, slot)
    A-->>C: re-render with new weeklyBudget + groceryList
    end

    rect rgb(255, 243, 224)
    Note over U,C: Flow 4 — Cooked It! → diary entry + timesCooked +1
    U->>C: submit Cooked It! form
    C->>A: onCookedIt(note, mood)
    A-->>V: new cookingLog entry appears
    A-->>B: card shows updated timesCooked
    end
```

### How each flow updates state (mechanism)

The diagram above shows *who calls what*. The mechanism behind each flow:

1. **Browser click → Detail updates** — clicking a card sets `selectedRecipeId`; `selectedRecipe` is derived from `recipes.find(r => r.id === selectedRecipeId)` each render.
2. **Filter change → Browser shrinks** — Controller writes `filters`; `filteredRecipes` is derived from `recipes.filter(matchesFilters)` and passed to Browser as a prop.
3. **Assign meal → Budget + Grocery recalculate** — Controller writes to `mealPlan`; `weeklyBudget` and `groceryList` are recomputed from `mealPlan` + `recipes` each render. No cached totals.
4. **"Cooked It!" → diary entry + timesCooked +1** — App immutably maps over `recipes` and updates the one whose id matches `selectedRecipeId`, prepending to `cookingLog` and incrementing `timesCooked`.

## Tech

- Vite + React 18 (JavaScript — no TypeScript)
- `useState` + props only. **No `useContext`, no Redux.** The component tree is 2 levels deep; lifting state to `App` is sufficient.
- Plain CSS, one file per component.
- Initial data hardcoded in [src/data/recipes.js](src/data/recipes.js). No backend, no fetch, no localStorage.

## Five Questions

### 1. Can I defend this?
Yes. Every major decision traces back to one idea: state lives in `App.jsx`, nowhere else. `recipes`, `selectedRecipeId`, `mealPlan`, and `filters` are the four state atoms. Everything downstream — filtered cards, weekly budget, grocery list — is *derived*, not stored. Components talk to `App` through props (down) and callback functions (up). I can point to every `useState` call in the app (there are five, four in `App.jsx` and one for the Cooked It! form draft) and justify why each one exists.

### 2. Is this mine?
The Design Intent drove every decision that shaped the system: the domain (solo cook's weekly planner), the Browser/Detail/Controller split, the recipe notebook visual mood, the data shape, the four state flows, the "Cooked It!" button as the emotional center. I wrote that doc before Claude touched any code. Claude wrote code *against* the spec; I didn't generate the spec *against* Claude's code.

### 3. Did I verify?
Yes. I walked the four required flows in the running app:
- Click any card in Browser → Detail View swaps to that recipe.
- Set "Under 15 min" filter → Browser shrinks from 30 → recipes matching.
- Assign a recipe to a day/slot → Weekly Budget goes up by its cost, Grocery List absorbs its ingredients.
- Submit Cooked It! → a new dated entry appears at the top of the diary, `timesCooked` increments on the Browser card.

The single-source-of-truth check: open React DevTools on `App`. All four state atoms are visible there. `Browser` and `DetailView` hold no state. `Controller` holds only draft-form state (`note`, `mood`) that enters shared state on submit — not a duplicate of anything.

### 4. Would I teach this?
Yes. The elevator version: *"If two components need the same data, move the data to the nearest parent they share. The parent holds it with `useState`, passes it to the children as props, and the children ask for changes by calling functions the parent gave them."* In this app, that parent is `App`. The data flows one direction (down), the change requests flow the other direction (up). Nothing loops back on itself — that's why the app stays predictable.

### 5. Is my documentation honest?
Yes. The [AI Direction Log](docs/ai-direction-log.md) records five real decisions I made during the build. The [Records of Resistance](docs/records-of-resistance.md) documents four actual moments where I said "no" to what Claude produced — storing `filteredRecipes`, reaching for `useContext`, styling before the wiring was proven, and a too-conservative grocery-list merge. Neither document is a reconstruction; they describe the session as it happened.
